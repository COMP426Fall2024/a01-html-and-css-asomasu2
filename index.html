            The Golden State Warriors have been a dominant force in the NBA for the the last decade,
            with their reign starting in the 2014-2015 season. Since then they went on to make the finals

            and these championships can be split into different eras. The first was the 
            beginning of it all, with a young Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson leading the team
            to countless victories, under their newly dubbed name the "Splash Bros". The Warriors
            only lost 15 games that season, with Curry average 23.8 points per game, followed closely by
            Thompson's 21.7 points per game. However, once the playoffs started, Curry dramatically 
            increased his scoring ouput, pouring in 28.3 points per game, and leading the Warriors to their
            first championship since 1975. The next two championships came in the <a href="kd.html">era of Kevin Durant.</a>
