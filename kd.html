            On July 4th, 2016, Kevin Durant made the infamous decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder <br>
            and sign with the Golden State Warriors. This Golden State Warriors team was widely considered a superteam, <br>
            and many NBA fans though this addition was overkill, even though they fell short in the title game the year prior.
