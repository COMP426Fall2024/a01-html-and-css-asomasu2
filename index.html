            The Golden State Warriors have been a dominant force in the NBA for the the last decade,
            with their reign starting in the 2014-2015 season. Since then they went on to make the finals
            in <ul>
                <li>2015</li>
                <li>2016</li>
                <li>2017</li>
                <li>2018</li>
                <li>2019</li>
                <li>2022</li>
                </ul>
            They won the NBA Championship in <ul>
                <li>2015</li>
                <li>2017</li>
                <li>2018</li>
                <li>2022</li>
                </ul>, and these championships can be split into different eras. The first was the 
                beginning of it all, with a young Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson leading the team
                to countless victories, under their newly dubbed name the "Splash Bros".
