        <p>
            On July 4th, 2016, Kevin Durant made the infamous decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder
            and sign with the Golden State Warriors. This Golden State Warriors team was widely considered a superteam,
            and many NBA fans though this addition was overkill, even though they fell short in the title game the year prior.
            Some speculated whether there would be a long adjusting period for the team, with Stephen Curry inevitably having
            less usage than the years prior. However, the team dominated the league immediately, with Curry and Durant averaging
            around 25 points per game, losing only fifteen games in the regular sesaon. The momentum carried on into the playoffs,
            as they lost only 1 game, and Kevin Durant won his first Finals MVP.

            Although they did not win as many games in the regular season as the year prior, Klay Thompson saw an increase in scoring
            output, dropping 20 points per game to help carry some of the offensive load. After a close conference finals against the 
            Houston Rockets, scraping by in a Game 7, they easily swept the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals, winning back to back
            titles and Kevin Durant earned his second Finals MVP.
