        After their championship in 2018, they made the finals the year after, but lost to the Toronto Raptors. The team
        went
        through a number of changes in between this season and the 2021-2022 season, leading to two dissapointing
        sesaons leading
        up to it.

        With many NBA analysts questioning whether the Warriors could contend for another title in the near future, they
        made
        two key additions before the beginning of the season. They signed Andrew Wiggins, and drafted Jordan Poole, two
        contributors that could make up for the loss of Kevin Durant. The team was perfectly balanced, with Stephen
        Curry once
        again leading the charge, just like 2015 season, and Klay Thompson looking like his old self. With a finish of
        3rd
        in the Western Conference, the Warriors cruised to the playoffs, not losing more than 2 games in any series.
        They beat
        a young but tough Boston Celtics team in the NBA Finals to get their fourth and last championship in the current
        Warriors
        dynasty.
